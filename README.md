# Language-Translator
##Overview

This project presents a basic Language Translator that converts English sentences into Chinese, and then back to English retaining the Chinese grammatical structure. It is designed to handle the subtle complexities that arise due to syntactic differences between the two languages.

##Features

Simple CSV-Based Translation: The program utilizes a straightforward CSV file that categorizes words into subjects, verbs, and objects.
SVO Syntax Support: Both English and Chinese predominantly use the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, facilitating direct translations for simple sentences.
Handling Complex Constructions: For more complex sentences, especially those involving structures like Subject-Verb-Object-Preposition (SVOP), the translation might deviate from standard English syntax, reflecting more closely how thoughts are structured in Chinese.
Purpose

This tool is particularly useful for individuals who think in Chinese and mentally translate thoughts into English, but naturally retain Chinese syntactic patterns. It aids in understanding how Chinese sentence structures might influence English expression.
