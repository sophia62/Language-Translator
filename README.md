# Language-Translator
Basic translator of English to Chinese, then back to the English version of the chinese grammar. I used a basic CSV file and seperated the subject, verbs, objects into their respective categories. The program uses the users imput to translate to chinese. Because english and chinese use the same SVO syntax, most of the translations will come out the same. When sentences become more complex, they differ from english. 
For example the STVPO examples in chinese.

This program is for people who translate the chinese in their head to english then use chinese syntax.
